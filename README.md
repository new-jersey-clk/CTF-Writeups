# Write ups by newjerseyclk

<br>
A repository for the flags I have found in CTFs that I have participated in.
<br>
**Notice:**
1. I am very new to the world of cyber and CTFs alike so these may not be the best writeups.
2. I am striving to learn more and more everyday about this subject.
3. If you have any tips or suggestions on how to preform a task better, whether that be formating in md or if there are any errors in my writeups, please feel free to let me know at soonest.
