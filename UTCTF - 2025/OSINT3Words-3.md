1. Using a similar method to Three Words 2 I used the University Facilities Services website (https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/campus/buildings/nlogon/facilities/) to find the building.
2. I soon found the building due to the similarities in windows, surroundings, and overall structure that it was the ANDREWS RESIDENCE HALL (AND – 0009) and the street name is Whitis Avenue.
+ Eventually I found the exact location due to some of the key landmarks which were…
    + The pair of signs seen in the left of the provided image.
    + The tree with concrete blocks surrounding it. (it was also the last tree on the opposite side of    the street from ANDREWS RESIDENCE HALL)
    + The front of the building matches the look in the image. (it even has a metal fence in the very    front of it which also matches the provided image)
    + The singular sign with a “K” on the right-hand side of the image.
3. With the location found I just had to Use the location of the tree seen in both the image and here on google earth [Here](https://earth.google.com/web/search/andrews+residence+building/@30.2878476,-97.74043828,185.14955139a,0d,67.51191976y,51.16392346h,92.65649941t,0r/data=CokBGlsSVQolMHg4NjQ0YjUwODRhOWEyYzVmOjB4MmI2YWM0NDEyMDkzZDcwZBkM1YM4xUk-QCG0AG2rWW9YwCoaYW5kcmV3cyByZXNpZGVuY2UgYnVpbGRpbmcYASABIiYKJAke8mavD0o-QBHVBWcv3Uc-QBlurG1eAG9YwCH-3gmCfG9YwEICCAEiGgoWZ2p0VGR4UWU0MW9XbWwzWFlfQkhEURACQgIIAEoNCP___________wEQAA)
4. I then went on [what3words](what3words.com) and approximated the exact position of the flag relative to the photo.
