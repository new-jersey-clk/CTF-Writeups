1. Used https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/campus/buildings/nlogon/facilities/utm/bat/ to filter through their facilities and look for any similarities with the building in the background.
2. Eventually found a similar looking building under the name BATTS HALL (BAT – 0073).
3. I input the address into Google Earth and used street view to confirm that it was the exact building in the photo. I then looked for any defining landmarks in the background.
+ I soon found three landmarks that pinpointed the location of where the photo was taken. These landmarks are…
    + A multi-labeled black and yellow sign reading “RESTRICTED LOADING DOCK – FOR LOADING & UNLOADING ONLY – NO PARKING”. (Angled towards the road towards BATTS HALL)
    + A “DO NOT ENTER – EXCEPT BICYCLES” sign (Slightly angled towards the building adjacent to BATTS HALL being GARRISON HALL)
    + A pair of waste bins with the tops color-coded to what waste they contained, blue being recycling and black being garbage. (clearly seen on the left in the photo provided, between both BATTS and GARRISON HALL)
4. I then shared the link of the street view from 128 Inner Campus Drive to Kalypse (one of my teammates) and he guessed the flag by matching the location of the address to the square on [what3words](what3words.com).
